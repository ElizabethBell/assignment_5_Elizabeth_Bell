For reduce.c, there are 4 command line arguments. Arg1 is the length of the array, arg2 is the number of threads, arg3 will be the scheduling type,
and arg4 is the number of iterations if the schedule is dynamic.

The scheduling types used in this project will both have a number associated with them, 1 being static and 2 being dynamic. If the scheduling type is static,
you will still need to enter a number for the iteration argument.

To compile without errors, you will need to use:

gcc -fopenmp -o reduce reduce.c
