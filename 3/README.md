For merge.c, there are 4 command line arguments. Arg1 is the length of the array, and arg2 is the number of threads.

The scheduling types used in this project will both have a number associated with them, 1 being static and 2 being dynamic. If the scheduling type is static,
you will still need to enter a number for the iteration argument.

You will not be able to set the scheduling type in this program.

To compile without errors, you will need to use:

gcc -fopenmp -o merge merge.c
